# Email Automation

## Project Information

Often times executives on campus clubs opt to send a non-personalized email when notifying candidates on their status for a leadership position they applied for. This lack of extra effort can damage how students perceive the club. As a result, Auto Send's goal is to help campus clubs maintain their image and to help executives send personalized emails without sacrificing unecessary time.

## How It Works

### Login
![Login](/photos/login.gif)

Login with your email and password. Before logging in, make sure you enable less secure apps and access to captchas. If you're worried about security, you can turn off these settings afterwards by clicking the same link (the captcha access will disable automatically after a few hours).

### Sending Emails

To send multiple emails, make sure to separate your values by a comma.

## Conclusion

Let me know if there are any issues that come up when you try to use the app. Other than that, enjoy!
